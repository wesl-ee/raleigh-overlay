Raleigh Overlay
===============

`raleigh-overlay` hosts ebuilds of my personal projects for use on Gentoo /
Funtoo systems. Ebuilds are written on a Funtoo Linux box but can be
integrated into a Gentoo environment with only a few changes.

Installation of this repository can be accomplished using `layman`.

LICENSE
-------

All ebuilds listed here are licensed GPLv3 for ease of integration with your
existing system, as most (if not all) ebuilds are also licensed GPLv3. Details
are in the `LICENSE` file.
